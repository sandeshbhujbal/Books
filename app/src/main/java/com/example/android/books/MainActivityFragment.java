Out of the Box brings together the very best of Harsha s writing, in a book that will be a veritable delight to any cricket fan. Knowledgeable, frank and witty, and with a sense of drama comparable to that of cricket itself, Harsha is a master at evoking the many moods of the game. And he is at his best when paying tribute to cricketing greats: Lara, Jayasuriya, Ganguly, Laxman, Dravid, Sehwag and the incomparable Tendulkar. As he follows India s fortunes on the cricket field at home and overseas, Harsha asks the question that is on everyone s lips today: can India really be no.1 in all three forms of the game? The answer lies in our history and in the pages of Out of the Box."));
